Configuration and Utility packages for Batch Applications in Java

The cubaja library simplifies some tasks of typical Java batch applications.

Highlights are

- transformation of complex XML configuration into a typesafe Java object tree
- read and write CSV (offers much more than usual CsvReaders)
- simplified usage of JDBC
- cursors which return iterators over complete data objects from CSV or a ResultSet
- generation of fast bytecode for bulk CSV and JDBC operations instead of reflection
- external sort, merge and match features for high volume data
- read and write mainframe data format

See the misc/guide.pdf for examples
